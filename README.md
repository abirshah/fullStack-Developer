# Autometed Pet Door System.
[SOEN 490] (Team fullStack-developer)

## Objective 
Create an automated pet door system which can recognize pet and open the door for coming inside or going outside.

## Description 
An automated pet door system which is able to recognize a pet through it's object detection mechanism.
Detection mechanism is built using Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts. A Machine Learning concept model buidls and trains itself with images and videos in order to detect an object. This Model can be used to detect various attributes of 
the object it detects in its surrounding enviornment. 
Features of the Automated System are:
- Pet Detection
- Open the door when pet is recognized
- Refuse entry to unknown and identifiable animals and objects
- Detect the type of the pet (cat, dog etc..)
- Log weight of the pet.
- Log size of the pet.
- Log color of the pet.

## Technologies
Autometed Pet Door System is created using following thechnologies and tools:
- [RasberryPI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) 
  <dd>RasberryPI (Model B) is a small, low cost computer, that runs linux and supports GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) connections, in order to interface with other physical objects</dd>
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
  <dd> Python is powerful programming language which can be used building various robust application.
  It is number one choice for developer application like Machine Learning because python offers various 
  open source libraries for creaing Machine Learning model</dd>
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  <dd>Github is a free service that allows open-source projects or unlimited private repositories.</dd>
- [Discord version: 74432](https://discord.com/)
  <dd>Discord is a VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities.</dd>
