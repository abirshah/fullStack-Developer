# Autometed Pet Door System [SOEN 490] (Team fullStack-developer)

## Objective 
Create an automated pet door system which can recognize pet and open the door for coming inside or going outside.

## Description 
An automated pet door system is an system which able to recognize pet through it's object detection mechanism.
Detection mechanism is build using Machine Learning and Deep Learning concept. Using Machine Learning concept model is 
build and train model with images and videos in order to detect an object. Model can be used to detect various nature of 
the object. In autometed pet door system, some of the feature would be:

- Detect of pet.
- Open the door when pet is recognize.
- If try to bring unknown animal such as bird, door sould not be open.
- Detect type of the pet such as cat, dog etc.
