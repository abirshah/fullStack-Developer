RasberryPI and hardware details

The RasberryPI is connected to three lights, blue, red and green.

The green and red lights represent the door being unlocked or locked, respectively.

When the electrical system is complete, its drivers or relays can be connected in place of the lights, for electro-mechanical control of the door

The blue light is turned on any time that the camera is activated.

The video demonstrates:

SN-114 - As a developer, I want the system to equip with a motion detection sensor, so the user doesn’t need to manually start the system.

SN-121 - As a developer, I want the pet door sensor to be active for 10 seconds when it detects an owner’s pet so that the system can process the signal to open the door.
